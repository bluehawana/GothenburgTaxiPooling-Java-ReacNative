# ðŸš– GÃ¶teborg Taxi System - Testing Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Option 1: Automatic Startup (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/bluehawana/Projects/Taxi
./start-services.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Startup

**Terminal 1: Backend (Port 8081)**
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**Terminal 2: Real-time Service (Port 3001)**
```bash
cd realtime-service
npm install
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing with Mock Orders

Once both services are running:

```bash
cd /Users/bluehawana/Projects/Taxi
node test-orders.js
```

This will create 5 mock orders that demonstrate:
- âœ… Automatic matchmaking after order creation
- âœ… Trip merging based on proximity and time
- âœ… Real-time notifications to drivers
- âœ… Cost savings calculations

## ðŸ”— Access Points

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Management Dashboard** | http://localhost:3001/dashboard.html | Real-time admin view |
| **Real-time Status** | http://localhost:3001/status | System statistics |
| **Backend API** | http://localhost:8081/api/trips/pending | Pending trips |
| **Shared Trips** | http://localhost:3001/api/shared-trips | Matched trips |
| **Active Drivers** | http://localhost:3001/api/active-drivers | Driver positions |

## ðŸ“± Mobile Apps

**Driver App:**
```bash
cd GothenburgTaxiDriver
npm install
npm start
```

**User App:**
```bash
cd GothenburgTaxiUser
npm install
npm start
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll See

### 1. **Management Dashboard**
- Live driver positions
- Shared trip creation in real-time
- Cost savings statistics
- Auto-refreshing data

### 2. **Order Processing Flow**
1. User creates trip â†’ Backend saves it
2. Matchmaking runs automatically
3. Compatible trips are merged
4. Real-time service notifies drivers
5. First driver to accept gets the trip
6. Dashboard shows live updates

### 3. **Driver Experience**
- Instant notifications for available trips
- Detailed trip information
- Easy accept/reject interface
- Real-time position sharing

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**Services won't start:**
- Check if ports 3001 and 8081 are free
- Ensure Node.js and Java are installed
- Verify database connection (MySQL on port 3306)

**No trips being matched:**
- Check console logs for matchmaking errors
- Verify trip times are in the future
- Ensure locations are within matching distance

**Dashboard not updating:**
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify WebSocket connection

## ðŸ“Š System Architecture

Database    Matchmaking          Management Dashboard
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

âœ… Backend responds at port 8081  
âœ… Real-time service responds at port 3001  
âœ… Dashboard shows live statistics  
âœ… Mock orders create shared trips  
âœ… Drivers receive notifications  
âœ… Cost savings are calculated  

The system is now fully functional with automatic order processing, real-time tracking, and comprehensive management tools!
